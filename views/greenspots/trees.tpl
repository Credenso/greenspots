	<h3>Client Information</h3>
	<p>We like to keep track of who's using Greenspots and how often. It would be possible to keep this information hidden, but we believe that it's best to be transparent when it comes to gathering information. We've chosen to celebrate our clientele by planting a tree at the bottom of the page for each unique IP address that visits. </p>

<p>You can tell which one is yours by the yellow highlighting. Each new day that you visit the webpage will make your tree grow a bit, so be sure to stop in lots okay?</p>
